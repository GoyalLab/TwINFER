    Reads an input matrix from a specified file path and returns its dimensions and content.

                              a comma-separated matrix of integers.

        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - int: The number of rows in the matrix.
            - np.ndarray: The matrix as a NumPy array. If the matrix is a single value,
                          it is reshaped into a 1x1 array.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the file cannot be loaded.
